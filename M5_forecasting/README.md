# Competition homepage

## This kaggle competition involves using forecasting methods to predict the sales for various items over a 28 day window for multiple store locations of Walmart in the USA.

## Evaluation
Weighted Root Mean Squared Scaled Error (RMSSE) of 28-day forecasting window

## Data

The data covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy.

1. It uses hierarchical sales data, generously made available by Walmart, starting at the item level and aggregating to that of departments, product categories, stores in three geographical areas of the US: California, Texas, and Wisconsin.
1. Besides the time series data, it also includes explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events (e.g. Super Bowl, Valentineâ€™s Day, and Orthodox Easter) that affect sales which are used to improve forecasting accuracy.
1. The distribution of uncertainty is being assessed by asking participants to provide information on four indicative prediction intervals and the median.
1. The majority of the more than 42,840 time series display intermittency (sporadic sales including zeros).
1. Instead of having a single competition to estimate both the point forecasts and the uncertainty distribution, there will be two parallel tracks using the same dataset, the first requiring 28 days ahead point forecasts and the second 28 days ahead probabilistic forecasts for the median and four prediction intervals (50%, 67%, 95%, and 99%).
1. For the first time, it focuses on series that display intermittency, i.e., sporadic demand including zeros.
